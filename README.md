# Drunk-Driving-Prediction-using-TensorFlow-sequential-model
The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning prediction model to predict the  likeliness of whether alcohol is involved during a car accident. Developing the prediction  model provides insights and understanding of a certain pattern to the occurrence of drunk  driving.
