# Drunk-Driving-Prediction-using-TensorFlow-sequential-model
The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning prediction model to predict the  likeliness of whether alcohol is involved during a car accident. Developing the prediction  model provides insights and understanding of a certain pattern to the occurrence of drunk  driving. 
## Things I learned:
* Data Preprocessing: Fill missing values, Tackle inconsistent data, Data Transformation.
* How to develop and optimize the Tensorflow Sequential prediction model accuracy and prediction.
